# Technology and courage

This is a very thoughtful personal reflection of Ivan Sutherland.

Some quotes are quite resonating:

> My advice for a new graduate student seeking to get started in research is to join an ongoing research group. Of course there is an opportunity cost to joining up with a particular group: you can't then join others. But it matters far less what a new stu- dent does than that he do something. If the first two or three things don't work out, you can always switch to another group or another project. The key thing is to get involved in something, get some basic knowledge, and get started.

加入一个课题组，任何一个，因为你需要跟别人在一起才会有碰撞和成长。


> Although business plans are rarely followed in any great detail, they are neverthe- less very useful. They build courage in the entrepreneurs by letting them plan a real business and see its potential profit. They provide a way for financial backers to understand the proposed business, milestones for measurement of progress, a common ground for discussing changes in plan, and a common target for both entrepreneurs and backers to seek. The plan's real function is to endow everyone with the courage to proceed.

虽说商业计划书没有实际意义，但是，写商业计划书的过程有助理清思路，这个过程还是有帮助的。



> The novelist writes a chapter a day, the musician does his scales and his selections each day, and the athlete does his setting up exercises and his main event. Each uses routine subtasks. I believe which particular routine sub tasks you choose are far less important than that you discipline yourself to do them regularly. My technology heroes have the courage to devote a period each day to the important tasks, leaving the merely urgent ones to fester if necessary.

只有把任务分解了，才会有动力去完成。


The rule for research is that you get credit only for ideas you have disclosed, not for ideas kept secret.
除非你把结果发表了，否则你的研究还没有完成。



> My group at Harvard in 1966 named its series of internal memos the “dis- play file,” a pun not only on the name of the part of computer memory that stores the output picture but also on the open file cabinet in which we kept these memos for easy access by any member of our group. My associates and I have used dis- play file memos ever since to record new ideas, new mathematical formulations, new circuits, and anything else that strikes our fancy, including local procedures for ordering lunch. Our series of display file memos has become my archive of familiar things from the past, an archive to which I turn from time to time for reminders. Some of them have later become patents, some full-fledged papers, and some portions of books. Initially, however, each was just my record of some little idea not always well expressed.

把你的阶段性研究成果放在别人容易看得到的地方，这样别人才有可能给你反馈。
